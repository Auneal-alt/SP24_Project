Collaboration Marlesha Ellis and Austin Neal. These 6 files are smay stems. We added a few lines of code and tested it to see if the efficiency increased when I hit optimize and it did slightly, so I called it good.
Scheduling was really tough with overlapping Exam3 with project and project with Final not to mention 3 other classes and Capstone. But with what little time we had we gave it a few tries before going the simplistic route of minor adjustments.
